Create a Scala web server. You only need to serve static HTML documents from the directory in which your program is run.
 If there is a request to a file that doesn't exist, return an appropriate 404 error message. 
You don't need to thread this implementation. You can use the java.net.URL and associated classes to help parse queries. 
Use ScalaTest http://www.scalatest.org/ and ScalaMock http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/testing_with_mock_objects 
to test your program. Here is a simple echo server in Scala.

import java.net._
import java.io._
import scala.io._

object EchoServer {
    def main(args: Array[String]) {
        val server = new ServerSocket(9999)
        while (true) {
            val s = server.accept()
            val in = new BufferedSource(s.getInputStream()).getLines()
            val out = new PrintStream(s.getOutputStream())

            out.println(in.next())
            out.flush()
            s.close()
        }
    }
}
